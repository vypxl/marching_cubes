# Marching Cubes

This is a demo of the marching cubes algorithm which I created just for fun.

## How to build (Linux)
You will need `make`, `gcc/g++`, `freetype2`, `glew`, `glfw`, `glm` and `opengl` installed.

Build: `make build` (you will find the executable in out/sortviz)
Run: `make run`
Delete build files: `make clean`

Built executable can be found in `out/glapp` or run directly via `make run`.
